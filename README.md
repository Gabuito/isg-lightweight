  ISG-Lightweight
</h1>
</p>

A lightweight, easy-to-use package for searching Google Images and optionally downloading them locally. Built with Puppeteer for reliable web scraping and Sharp for high-quality image processing.

> **Note**: ISG-Lightweight is fully asynchronous. All functions return Promises and should be used with async/await or Promise chains.

## Project Origin

ISG-Lightweight was created out of the need for an easy-to-use tool to quickly capture placeholder images during learning and development processes. While developing applications and websites, having quick access to relevant images for testing layouts, components, and user interfaces is invaluable. This library aims to simplify that process, providing a straightforward way to obtain test images without interrupting your workflow. We hope this tool can help others who need similar functionality during their own learning journey and development projects.


Based on [pevers/images-scraper](https://github.com/pevers/images-scraper)


## Installation

```bash
npm install isg-lightweight
```

## Local Development

To use ISG-Lightweight locally during development:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabuioli/ISG-Lightweight.git
cd ISG-Lightweight
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Create a global symlink:

```bash
npm link
```

5. In your project, link to the local version:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
npm link isg-lightweight
```

This creates a symbolic link from your global node_modules to your local development version, allowing you to test changes immediately.

## Basic Usage

### ES Modules (ESM)

```javascript
import ISG from 'isg-lightweight';

// Get image URLs only
const imageUrls = await ISG('cute cats');
console.log(imageUrls);
// Output: ['https://example.com/cat1.jpg', 'https://example.com/cat2.jpg']
```

### CommonJS

```javascript
const { default: ISG } = require('isg-lightweight');

// Get image URLs only
(async () => {
  const imageUrls = await ISG('cute cats');
  console.log(imageUrls);
  // Output: ['https://example.com/cat1.jpg', 'https://example.com/cat2.jpg']
})();
```

### Search and Save Images Locally

#### ESM

```javascript
import ISG from 'isg-lightweight';

// Search for images and save them locally
const imageUrls = await ISG('cute cats', {
  imageConfig: {
    format: 'webp',
    quality: 85
  }
});

// Images will be saved to ./downloads/cute cats/
```

#### CommonJS

```javascript
const { default: ISG } = require('isg-lightweight');

(async () => {
  // Search for images and save them locally
  const imageUrls = await ISG('cute cats', {
    imageConfig: {
      format: 'webp',
      quality: 85
    }
  });
  
  // Images will be saved to ./downloads/cute cats/
})();
```

### Using Individual Functions

#### ESM

```javascript
import { GetURL, SaveFrom } from 'isg-lightweight';

// Only search for images
const imageUrls = await GetURL('mountain landscapes', { 
  limit: 5,
  timeout: 3000 
});

// Manually save an image
await SaveFrom('https://example.com/landscape.jpg', 'landscapes', { 
  format: 'png',
  quality: 90 
});
```

#### CommonJS

```javascript
const { GetURL, SaveFrom } = require('isg-lightweight');

(async () => {
  // Only search for images
  const imageUrls = await GetURL('mountain landscapes', { 
    limit: 5,
    timeout: 3000 
  });

  // Manually save an image
  await SaveFrom('https://example.com/landscape.jpg', 'landscapes', { 
    format: 'png',
    quality: 90 
  });
})();
```
